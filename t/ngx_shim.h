 *
 * That file parses a query string, and a query-string parser is worth testing
 * exhaustively: the boundary rule ("fault_slab=" must start the query or follow
 * an '&'), the malformed-input contract (NGX_DECLINED, never a best guess), and
 * the digit bound. None of that needs a server, a worker, or shared memory --
 * but reaching it through a real build needs all three, which is why it had no
 * tests at all.
 *
 * Purpose-built for that one translation unit; not a general nginx emulation.
 * That is deliberate. The ten shim headers across labs/ were measured in July
 * 2026 and share almost nothing -- each stubs exactly the surface its own
 * target touches. A merged "common" shim would be a superset nobody needs plus
 * a coupling every consumer pays for.
