# the daemon binds a port and writes it where a scenario can find it, that a
# real client on a real socket gets the reply the codec built, that the faults
# actually fire on the wire, and that the journal records what happened. A fake
# upstream whose codecs are perfect and whose socket handling is broken passes
# backend_test completely.
#
# Clients here are bash's /dev/tcp rather than nc, which is not installed

# ---- the portfile is never observable as zero-length ------------------------
#
# The atomicity property, tested directly rather than through its symptom.
#
# The daemon writes PATH.tmp, fsyncs and renames. Written in place instead, the
# file is briefly visible with no contents, and the polling loop in start_srv --
# and in every scenario that will use this daemon -- reads an empty port. It
# reproduces roughly one run in twenty, which is exactly the frequency at which
# a CI leg gets disabled rather than fixed.
#
# Racing the window directly does NOT work as a gate, and the first draft of
# this test proved it the expensive way: a shell loop watching for an
# existing-but-empty file caught the in-place mutant on this machine and
# SURVIVED it on CI, where the daemon reaches its first write before the loop's
# first stat. A detector whose sensitivity depends on the host is not a gate.
#
# So assert the MECHANISM instead, which is timing-independent. A daemon that
# renames into place has, at the instant the final path appears, already written
# and fsynced a sibling `.tmp` -- so the final path is never observed empty, and
# the temporary never outlives the rename. Writing in place satisfies neither:
# it creates the final path itself, and creates no sibling at all.
#
# `inotifywait` would observe the window directly, but it is not installed on
# every runner and a test that silently skips is worse than one that is coarse.
