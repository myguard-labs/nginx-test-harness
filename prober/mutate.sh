# Mutation smoke test: break the code on purpose, and require the suite to
# notice.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. This repo's self-tests decide whether a module's run is
# green, so a test that cannot fail is worse than a missing one -- the run still
# reports success. A passing suite proves the tests RAN; only a failing one
# proves they ASSERT. Every directive added here has been mutation-checked by
# hand, and that ritual has caught a real defect on each of the last three
# passes -- including one (a dropped SO_LINGER) where the feature's entire
# effect was untested behind assertions that looked thorough.
#
# Doing it by hand is where the danger is. Three separate failure modes have
# each produced a result that READ like "the mutation was caught" when nothing
# of the sort happened:
#
#   1. The mutation did not compile. The build fails, the STALE binary from the
#      last build runs, the suite goes red -- indistinguishable from a caught
#      mutation unless the build's exit status is checked. The -Werror wall
#      makes this common: zeroing a parameter's only use trips
#      -Werror=unused-parameter, so `x * 0` is the safe form, not `0`.
#   2. The edit did not apply. A sed expression that silently matches nothing
#      leaves the code pristine; the suite passes; that reads as SURVIVED and
#      sends you hunting a coverage gap that does not exist.
#   3. The wrong suite was run. A transport mutation checked against the parser
#      tests survives trivially, because those tests never touch the transport.
#
# So this script verifies, for every mutation: that the patch changed the file,
# that the build succeeded, and that the named suite -- not merely some suite --
# went red. Anything else is reported as a BROKEN mutation, never as a result.
#
# Usage:  ./mutate.sh            run every mutation
#         ./mutate.sh SO_LINGER  run those whose name matches a substring
#
# Each mutant's suite is bounded by MUT_SUITE_TIMEOUT seconds (default 120); a
# timeout counts as a caught mutation. Exit status is 0 only when every mutation
# was caught.
