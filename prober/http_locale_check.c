 * http_locale_check.c -- dedicated Turkish-i regression case for
 * http_has_header(), run standalone under LC_ALL=tr_TR.UTF-8 by the
 * locale-hostility CI job.
 *
 * CONFIRMED, not refuted: glibc's tr_TR.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE table makes 'I' and
 * 'i' FIXED POINTS of tolower()/toupper() -- tolower('I') == 'I' (not 'i'),
 * toupper('i') == 'i' (not 'I') -- rather than the C-locale mapping where
 * they fold onto each other. glibc's strncasecmp()/strcasecmp() consult that
 * same LC_CTYPE table (POSIX permits, and glibc's implementation does, use
 * locale-aware case folding here -- this is NOT the ASCII-only guarantee an
 * earlier draft of this comment assumed; verified empirically, see below).
 * The practical effect: strncasecmp("ICE-Auth", "ice-auth", 8) == 0 under the
 * C locale and != 0 under tr_TR.UTF-8, because the two 'I'/'i' no longer fold
 * to the same case. http_has_header() in prober/http.c is a direct
 * strncasecmp() consumer over raw response header bytes, so a header whose
 * name or value differs from the needle only in 'I'/'i' casing silently stops
 * matching under this locale.
 *
 * A near-miss while proving this: an earlier verification pass ran
 * `locale-gen tr_TR.UTF-8` without first uncommenting `tr_TR.UTF-8 UTF-8` in
 * /etc/locale.gen. locale-gen exits 0 and regenerates whatever IS listed
 * (en_US in that case) without complaint about the one that is not, so the
 * locale silently resolved back to "C" and every assertion below "passed"
 * for the wrong reason. Caught by mutation-testing this file against a
 * properly regenerated locale afterward -- the same house rule that applies
 * to every other gate in this repo applies to a locale fixture too: prove it
 * can fail before trusting that it passed. The CI job below generates the
 * locale from a heredoc-appended /etc/locale.gen line specifically to avoid
 * depending on whatever the runner image shipped commented out.
