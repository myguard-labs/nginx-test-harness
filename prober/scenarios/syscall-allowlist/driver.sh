# Scenario: the request path's syscall SURFACE. Every other scenario asserts on
# what the server RETURNS -- status, body, fd deltas, log lines. This one asserts
# on HOW it got there: the set of syscalls the worker issues while answering a
# burst of ordinary requests. A module that quietly starts calling getrandom,
# opening a file, spawning a socket, or exec-ing a helper changes that set, and
# a consumer should have to acknowledge the new capability (by editing
# baseline.syscalls) rather than have it slip in unremarked.
#
# INSTRUMENT. strace -f -c ATTACHES to the already-running worker (ptrace, no
# rebuild, no LD_PRELOAD), counts syscalls across a fixed burst of probe
# requests, then detaches. The `-c` summary's last column is the syscall name;
# the union of those names is the observed set. The gate: every observed name
# must appear in baseline.syscalls, or the run is red. It is one-directional --
# a baseline name NOT observed is fine (allowlist, not fingerprint) -- so it does
# not flake on a kernel that satisfies an epoll from cache or coalesces a write.
#
# WHY ATTACH, NOT BOOT-WRAP. Wrapping the boot in strace would fold nginx's
# startup syscalls (open the conf, the logs, the shared libs, map them) into the
# set -- a large, version-variable surface that has nothing to do with the
# request path under test. Attaching to the worker AFTER boot and firing
# requests isolates exactly the per-request surface, which is both the stable
# thing to baseline and the thing a module actually influences.
#
# WHY A DRIVER, NOT A .rule. The prober speaks HTTP; it has no notion of
# attaching a tracer to the server it is probing or diffing a syscall set. This
# is server-side introspection the rule DSL cannot express.
#
# CROSS-VERSION STABILITY. The observed set on a bare request path is small and
# stable across nginx mainline, stable, and angie: accept4/close for the
# connection, epoll_ctl/epoll_wait for readiness, recvfrom for the request,
# write/writev for the response, setsockopt for per-connection options. The near
# neighbours a different kernel/libc can substitute (accept, epoll_pwait, recv,
# read, send/sendto) are pre-listed in baseline.syscalls so a benign
# substitution is not mistaken for a new capability.

# `ok N - <scenario> # SKIP <reason>` (same idiom as run-scenario.sh's requires
# gate). The real `1..2` plan is emitted only once every precondition holds, so a
# skipped leg reports as SKIPPED, not as two vacuous passes.
#
# A sanitizer-instrumented server pollutes the request-path syscall set with the
# runtime's own calls -- ASan maps its shadow and services allocations lazily,
# so the worker issues an `mmap` (and can issue more, version-dependently) while
# answering a probe that the bare build never makes. That is the sanitizer's
# surface, not the module's; gating it here would either flake or force us to
# widen baseline.syscalls with runtime noise that dulls the gate on every OTHER
# leg. The syscall surface is only a meaningful contract on an uninstrumented
# binary, so on a sanitizer build this scenario SKIPs -- the same
# environment-fact contract as strace being absent or ptrace being restricted.
