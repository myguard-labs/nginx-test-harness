# Scenario: a reload is not "done" when a new worker answers, and it is not
# done when the old worker has gone either. This scenario gates on the one
# property those two oracles cannot supply -- that the worker now answering is
# running the configuration that was just loaded -- and proves the gate is
# worth having by requiring an observable config change to be live before the
# assertions are allowed to speak.
#
# THE RACE THIS CLOSES. prober_signal_wait returns when a DIFFERENT worker pid
# answers; prober_drain_wait returns when the master is back to its configured
# worker count. Both can hold while the server still serves the OLD config:
#
#   - A reload the master REJECTED. nginx tests the new configuration and, on a
#     parse or bind failure, logs the error and keeps the running cycle exactly
#     as it was. Nothing crashes, nothing exits non-zero, and the old worker
#     keeps answering -- a scenario asserting on the new config's behaviour is
#     asserting against the old one and calling it a pass.
#   - Reloads that overlap. A second SIGHUP arriving while the first is still
#     being absorbed leaves more than one new cycle in flight, and "a new pid
#     answered" cannot say which of them owns it.
#
# THE ORACLE, and why it is shaped this way. The probe reports
# config_generation, a counter the master bumps once per config LOAD and every
# worker of that cycle inherits through fork (see ngx_test_probe.h for why this
# is a process global and not angie's cycle->generation, which nginx does not
# have at all). prober_config_wait requires the new value to be read STREAK
# times CONSECUTIVELY, each on a fresh connection, so a single read that
# happened to land on the new worker while the old one is still accepting
# cannot settle it. The streak is the probabilistic half; prober_drain_wait,
# called alongside it, is the deterministic half. Neither is a substitute for
# the other and this scenario uses both.
#
# WHY THE MARKER EXISTS. A generation counter that only ever asserts about
# itself is the classic vacuous gate: it would stay green if the config it
# claims to track were never applied at all. So each reload REWRITES the
# rendered conf (a `marker=<n>` in the / response body) and the driver requires
# the served body to carry the new marker before it accepts the generation as
# meaningful. That makes "the new config is live" falsifiable from outside the
# probe entirely -- if config_generation advanced but the body still reads the
# old marker, the counter is lying and oracle 3 reds while oracle 2 stays green.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS. Both were run locally against nginx 1.29.0 and the tree
# restored afterwards -- see lessons.md: this repo IS the harness, so a planted
# failure is a control proving the GATE fires, never a bug to fix.
#
#   A. The gate must fail on a REJECTED reload. Rewrite the conf to something
#      nginx refuses to parse (an unterminated block), then SIGHUP. The master
#      logs the error and keeps serving; prober_signal_wait may still see a new
#      pid from an unrelated respawn, but config_generation NEVER advances.
#      Result: oracle 2 reds with "the generation never advanced", which is the
#      whole point of the scenario. Verified: run with STREAK=20 and a broken
#      conf and the driver exits 1 rather than waiting forever.
#
#   B. The marker must be load bearing. Neutralise the sed rewrite (leave the
#      conf unchanged between reloads) while still sending the signal. The
#      generation still advances -- a reload of an IDENTICAL config is still a
#      config load -- so oracle 2 stays green, and oracle 3 reds because the
#      body never carries the marker the driver asked for. That is the vacuity
#      check working: it proves oracle 3 is not merely restating oracle 2.
