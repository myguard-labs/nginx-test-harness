# Scenario: a USR2 binary upgrade. The running master holds a worker whose
# keepalive pool has a parked upstream (memcached) connection. USR2 forks a NEW
# master that execs the (same) binary and spawns a NEW worker; that worker
# inherited NONE of the old worker's keepalive pool, so the first request it
# answers MUST open a fresh upstream connection. The old master is then retired
# (WINCH to drain its workers, QUIT to stop it) and the new master must keep
# serving correctly on its own.
#
# This closes the last P1-D gap the harness could not reach: the binary-upgrade
# path for a module holding upstream keepalive state. cache-turbo's memcached
# pool is proven at config time and, since #76, across an idle-close + reload --
# but a USR2 exec discards the pool wholesale, a different transition, and
# nothing proved the new master's worker reconnects rather than reusing a
# descriptor it never inherited.
#
# The falsifiable instrument is the backend JOURNAL accept count -- the same
# oracle #76 uses. A request answered by the new-exec worker must add at least
# one accept; reuse of a (non-existent, un-inherited) parked connection would
# add zero. No module log settles reuse-vs-reopen as directly.
#
# Why a driver and not a .rule file: USR2 is a signal to the master and the
# proof spans two master generations (old + new), with the pidfile changing
# hands underneath. The prober runs cases back to back with no signal delivery
# and no notion of a master pid, so it cannot drive this.
#
# BOOT CONTRACT: this scenario runs under PROBER_DAEMON_MODE=on (see env). The
# master is daemonized and tracked by $PROBER_PREFIX/nginx.pid, not $!. On USR2,
# the old master RENAMES its pidfile to nginx.pid.oldbin and the new master
# writes a fresh nginx.pid -- this driver reads both to target each generation.
