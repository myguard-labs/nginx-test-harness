# Scenario: the server is reloaded (SIGHUP) N times in a row while otherwise
# idle. Each reload builds a NEW cycle -- a fresh cycle pool, a fresh worker,
# re-opened listening sockets -- and must release the OLD one. The classic
# module failure this catches is a per-cycle allocation or descriptor that is
# created in an init_module / init_process hook and never released when the
# cycle it belongs to goes away: nothing fails, nothing logs, and the process
# simply grows one cycle's worth on every reload for the life of the server.
#
# Why a driver and not a plain .rule file: a reload happens BETWEEN prober
# invocations, and the state that matters is a comparison of probe snapshots
# taken on either side of a signal that no single prober case can straddle.
# The prober's own per-case `delta` machinery measures within one case; this
# scenario needs the across-reload axis.
#
# THE ORACLES, and why each is the shape it is:
#
#   Worker cycle-pool counters (pool.cycle_used / cycle_blocks / cycle_large).
#   Each reload's worker builds its cycle pool by parsing the SAME config with
#   the same binary, so a healthy series produces the SAME counters every time.
#   The assertion is therefore EXACT EQUALITY between the first post-reload
#   snapshot and every later one -- not a band. A band here would be the weaker
#   claim, and the quantity genuinely is deterministic once the old cycle has
#   drained: measured identical across the series on nginx 1.29.0, nginx 1.31.3
#   and angie 1.12.0, over repeated runs. A module leaking into ngx_cycle->pool
#   per reload moves these monotonically.
#
#   Worker descriptor count (fds). A worker that inherits a descriptor from the
#   cycle before it -- the shape that eventually exhausts the process -- shows
#   up as a post-reload fd count that climbs with the reload index. Exact
#   equality again, and for the same reason.
#
#   MASTER descriptor count (/proc/<master>/fd). The worker-side counters can
#   only ever see the cycle the worker was forked into; a cycle leaked in the
#   MASTER (the process that actually keeps the old cycle alive until its
#   workers are gone) is invisible to them. A leaked listening socket or old
#   cycle fd in the master is deterministic and countable, which makes it the
#   sharp master-side oracle. Linux-only: skipped, VISIBLY, where /proc is not
#   readable, never silently dropped.
#
#   MASTER resident size (/proc/<master>/statm). The only signal available for
#   a master-side leak that is memory rather than descriptors. It is COARSE on
#   purpose: an allocator that does not return freed pages to the OS keeps RSS
#   flat over a leak of a few KiB, so this can only catch a gross one, and it
#   is given a generous band rather than a tight one to avoid a flaky gate
#   making a claim it cannot support. It is a backstop for the fd oracle above,
#   not a replacement for it.
#
# On pid oracles: every post-reload worker must still be a CHILD OF THE SAME
# MASTER (probe field "ppid" -- absent from a module .so built before that
# field existed, which becomes a visible skip, see snapshot() below). prober_signal_wait's own oracle is "a different
# pid answered", which a crashed-and-respawned worker satisfies just as well as
# a reloaded one; the ppid check plus the error-log scan below is what separates
# the two. A master that itself died and was restarted by something outside the
# harness would change ppid, and that must fail rather than read as a reload.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS. Both were run locally against nginx 1.29.0 and the fixture
# restored afterwards -- see lessons.md: this repo IS the harness, so a planted
# "leak" is a control proving the GATE fires, never a real bug to fix. Each is
# planted in t/module's config handler (which runs once per config load, i.e.
# once per cycle) and the ref .so rebuilt (recipe in the s97 handoff block).
#
#   A. Per-cycle POOL accumulation -- a static counter incremented per config
#      load, allocating from the cycle pool in proportion to it:
#          static ngx_uint_t n = 0;  n++;  ngx_palloc(cf->pool, 64 * n);
#      Result: assertion 3 reds on cycle_used alone, climbing +64 per reload
#      (63855, 63919, 63983, ...), every other assertion green -- which is the
#      point, since the other oracles are blind to this class.
#      Sizing matters: the first attempt allocated 4096 * n and did NOT red,
#      because an allocation of a page or more goes to the pool's LARGE list
#      and never reaches cycle_used. That is exactly why this scenario asserts
#      cycle_blocks and cycle_large alongside it rather than cycle_used alone.
#
#   B. Per-cycle DESCRIPTOR leak -- ngx_open_file("/dev/null") per config load,
#      never closed. Result: assertion 3 reds on fds (12, 13, 14, ... one per
#      reload) AND assertion 6 reds on the master (9 -> 17 over 8 reloads),
#      confirming the worker-side and master-side oracles both fire and are
#      not measuring the same thing twice.
