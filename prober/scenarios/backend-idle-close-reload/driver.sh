# Scenario: the module holds an upstream (memcached) connection in its keepalive
# pool; the backend hangs that parked connection up while it is idle. The next
# request must NOTICE the peer closed and RECONNECT -- open a fresh upstream
# connection -- rather than write down the dead descriptor. A reload is then
# folded in on top: after the pool has already had to reconnect once, a SIGHUP
# lands and a post-reload request must still serve correctly.
#
# This closes the L14 gap: cache-turbo's memcached keepalive pool has
# config-time rejection tests only, and nothing anywhere proves the runtime
# reconnect-after-idle-close path. The falsifiable instrument is the backend
# JOURNAL: only it can distinguish a connection the module REUSED (one accept)
# from one it REOPENED (a second accept). No module log settles it as directly.
#
# Why a driver and not a plain .rule file: the reconnect only happens if a real
# time gap separates the two requests -- long enough for the backend's idle
# timer to fire and close the parked connection -- and that ordering is proven
# by polling the journal for the idle-close fault, not by a sleep. The prober
# runs cases back to back with no such gap and no signal delivery, so it cannot
# drive this on its own.
