 * backend.h -- the fake upstream: protocol codecs, script parser, fault model.
 *
 * Split from fakesrv.c on the same principle as rules.h: everything here is a
 * pure function over bytes, so backend_test.c can exercise the parser and the
 * codecs without a socket, a port or a running server. fakesrv.c owns main(),
 * poll() and the syscalls; this unit never touches a file descriptor.
 *
 * WHY A FAKE AT ALL. A real redis or memcached is the wrong instrument for the
 * cases that matter here. It cannot be made to truncate a reply mid-VALUE, to
 * declare a length it then contradicts, to reset a connection after eight
 * bytes, or to close a parked keepalive connection at the moment of a reload --
 * and those are precisely the paths where an upstream module's error handling
 * either releases its resources or leaks them. Nor can a real daemon REPORT
 * what it saw: the JSONL journal this unit's server half writes is what makes
 * "the connection was reused" a falsifiable claim rather than an assumption.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a real cache. The moment a scenario needs eviction or
 * expiry semantics it should point at a real daemon instead; a fake that grows
 * toward being a real redis is a second implementation to keep correct, and its
 * bugs would be indistinguishable from the module's.
 *
 *
 * SCRIPT FORMAT -- `.backend` files, stanza style mirroring `.rule`:
 *
 *     proto   memcached
 *     seed    hello  world
 *     fault   on=get:3     action=truncate    after=8
 *     fault   on=get:*     action=lie_bytes   delta=+5
 *     fault   on=set:1     action=rst
 *     fault   on=connect:2 action=accept_close
 *     fault   on=get:2     action=drip        bytes=1 ms=5
 *     fault   on=idle      action=close_after ms=100
 *     fault   on=get:4     action=raw         data=VALUE k 0 3\r\nAB\0\r\nEND\r\n
 *
 * The default behaviour with no faults is a CORRECT server backed by a real
 * in-memory key/value store. That is the load-bearing design decision, and the
 * alternative was considered and rejected: a positional list of canned replies
 * cannot express a keepalive test, because the number of `get`s nginx will
 * issue is exactly what such a test is trying to discover. Encoding the reply
 * count into the script encodes the answer into the question. Faults are
 * therefore OVERLAYS on correct behaviour, keyed by (command glob : occurrence
 * index), so a script says what goes wrong and when, and says nothing at all
 * about the traffic it does not perturb.
 *
 * `on=` is `<command-glob>:<nth>` where `<nth>` is a 1-based occurrence counter
 * or `*` for every occurrence. The counter is per-command and per-run, not
 * per-connection: `get:3` means the third `get` this daemon sees, which is what
 * a scenario can predict. Two pseudo-commands cover what is not a command at
 * all: `connect:<nth>` fires as the nth connection is accepted, and `idle`
 * fires on a connection that has gone quiet.
 *
 * `action=raw` is the escape hatch, and carries most of the adversarial
 * surface: embedded NULs, an oversize declared length, a reply that arrives
 * when none was due, RESP `$-1` nil against a malformed near-miss. It uses the
 * same `\r \n \t \\ \" \0 \xNN` escapes as a rule file's `send`, through the
 * same lexer (util.h), so the two formats cannot drift on what a byte means.
