# TAP self-test for prober_probe_field (lib.sh), the extractor every driver
# reads probe counters through.
#
# Why it needs its own test rather than being covered by the scenarios that use
# it: a field extractor fails SILENTLY. If it returned an empty string for a
# field the probe never emitted, every driver doing arithmetic on the result
# would read it as 0 -- and 0 is a perfectly plausible delta, so a probe body
# that lost a counter (an older module .so, a build without it) would certify
# "nothing grew" instead of failing. A scenario running against a healthy server
# can never distinguish those two, because both come out green. Only a test
# holding a body with a KNOWN-absent field can.
#
# The prefix case is the other half: `"pid"` must not be satisfied by `"ppid"`,
# which is a real field emitted immediately next to it in the same body. An
# unanchored matcher would make a worker's parent pid answer to a request for
# the worker's own -- and the two are equal in no configuration, so the error
# would surface as an unexplained mismatch in an unrelated assertion.
