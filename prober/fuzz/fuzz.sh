# Build and run the prober's parser fuzz targets, in one of two modes.
#
#   ./fuzz.sh replay              corpus replay under gcc + ASan/UBSan (PR path)
#   ./fuzz.sh fuzz [SECONDS]      libFuzzer discovery under clang (scheduled)
#
# replay is deterministic and engine-free: it links each fuzz_<t>.c with the
# standalone driver, feeds the checked-in corpus/<t>/ once, and exits nonzero on
# the first crash or sanitizer abort. That is the vacuous-gate defence -- there
# is no "report and continue" path, only the process living or dying.
#
# fuzz needs clang (-fsanitize=fuzzer) and mutates unbounded, so it is a
# scheduled discovery job, never on the per-commit path. It writes new crashers
# to crashes/<t>/ for triage.
