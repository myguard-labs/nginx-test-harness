# prober/fuzz — parser fuzz targets

Engine-neutral libFuzzer targets for the prober's byte-consuming parsers, plus a
standalone corpus-replay driver so the same targets run on the PR path under
plain gcc without any fuzzing engine.

## Targets

Each `fuzz_<t>.c` defines only `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` and nothing else, so it
links equally under `-fsanitize=fuzzer` (clang) and under the standalone driver
(gcc). Chosen because each consumes untrusted, attacker-shaped bytes whose
interesting inputs a live socket will not produce on demand:

| target      | function                    | interesting inputs |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| `json`      | `json_parse_n`              | embedded NUL, deep nesting, double-overflow number, truncated escape |
| `http`      | `http_parse_response`       | no header terminator, body containing CRLFCRLF, embedded NUL, truncated status line |
| `memcached` | `backend_parse_memcached`   | storage command with a lying data-length, too many args, unterminated line |
| `resp`      | `backend_parse_resp`        | lying `$` bulk length, overrunning `*` multibulk count, embedded NUL in a bulk value |

`rules.c`'s `load_rules` is deliberately **not** a target: it takes a file path
and `die()`s on any syntax error by design, so every malformed input "crashes" —
a fuzz target over it would be vacuous.

## The two halves

**PR path — deterministic replay, no engine (`fuzz.sh replay`).** Links each
target with `fuzz_standalone.c` (the LLVM StandaloneFuzzTargetMain pattern:
`main` feeds each corpus file once to the target) under gcc + ASan/UBSan, over
the checked-in `corpus/<t>/`. A crash or sanitizer abort exits nonzero and fails
the run. There is no "report and continue" path — only the process living or
dying — which is what makes this gate impossible to render vacuous. Wired into
`ci.yml`'s `fuzz-replay` job.

**Scheduled path — discovery (`fuzz.sh fuzz [seconds]`).** Needs clang
(`-fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined`). Mutates unbounded on a time budget,
writing new crashers to `crashes/<t>/`. Off the per-commit path in `fuzz.yml`
(cron + `workflow_dispatch`), staggered against the other scheduled workflows.

## Non-vacuity proof

Plant an out-of-bounds read in `json_parse_n` (e.g. `s.end = text + len + 4;`)
and run `./fuzz.sh replay`: the `bignum`/`obj` seed drives the over-read, ASan
aborts, and the script exits 1. Restore the source and it exits 0. This is the
same mutation ritual every gate in this repo is held to — a fuzzer that reports
but exits 0 is the canonical vacuous fuzz gate, and neither path admits it: the
standalone driver has no reporting path at all (a crash kills the process), and
the scheduled discovery run turns any crasher into a nonzero exit via the
`collect crashers` step in `fuzz.yml` (which greps `crashes/` and `exit 1`s),
since libFuzzer itself already exits nonzero on a crash under ASan.

## Corpus

`corpus/<t>/` holds small valid + edge seeds. Empty files are legitimate seeds
(they exercise the `size == 0` edge) and are carried on purpose. New crashers
found by the scheduled run should be minimized and added here so the PR path
regression-guards them from then on.
