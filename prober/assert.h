 *
 * Split out of prober.c so it can be exercised without a server. This code IS
 * the verdict: everything else in the harness exists to put a document in front
 * of it. An evaluator that returns "pass" where it should return "fail" makes
 * every rule that depends on it untestable-by-construction, and the run still
 * reports green -- which is worse than having no rule, because the green is
 * believed.
 *
 * Both entry points return 1 on pass and 0 on fail, and on fail write a
 * human-readable reason into `why`. There is no third outcome: a path that
 * cannot be evaluated (absent, wrong type, unusable literal) is a failure, not
 * a skip, because a skip would be indistinguishable from a pass in TAP.

 * Verify the worker that answered the after-snapshot is the one that answered
 * the before-snapshot.
 *
 * This is not driven by a rule directive: it applies to every case, because a
 * worker that segfaults mid-request is respawned by the master, and the retry
 * the client never sees can still produce the status and body the rule asked
 * for. The case then reports ok while the module under test crashed. A changed
 * pid is that crash, and it is visible with no sanitizer and no module C.
 *
 * Unlike a delta, an absent or non-numeric "pid" is a failure rather than
 * something to compare: the pid is rendered unconditionally by the generic
 * half of the probe, so its absence means the document is not the document
 * this oracle thinks it is, and silently skipping would turn the check off
 * everywhere at once. The same holds for "ppid" whenever it is consulted.
 *
 * `may_change` selects WHICH invariant is asserted; it never disables the
 * oracle. It is 0 by default, and set by a case's `pid_may_change` directive.
 *
 *   0 -- same worker. The strict form: the after-pid must equal the before-pid.
 *        REQUIRES worker_processes 1. "The worker" is only a meaningful subject
 *        with one of them: several live workers answer consecutive probe
 *        requests in turn, so the pid changes on a server that is perfectly
 *        healthy and every case fails. The conf belongs to the consumer, so
 *        this cannot be enforced here -- run.sh checks the rendered file and
 *        bails before the first case instead.
 *
 *   1 -- same master. The after-pid may differ, but its "ppid" must equal the
 *        before-snapshot's "ppid". This is what a case spanning a reload needs:
 *        a SIGHUP replaces the worker ON PURPOSE, so pid equality reports a
 *        crash on a server doing exactly what the scenario asked. It is also
 *        what a multi-worker conf needs, for the same reason.
 *
 *        KNOW WHAT THIS GIVES UP. A crash-respawned worker has the SAME master
 *        as a reload-respawned one -- measured, not assumed: SIGKILLing a
 *        worker of master M yields a replacement whose ppid is still M. So
 *        this form does NOT distinguish a crash from a reload, and a module
 *        that segfaults inside a case carrying this directive is reported ok.
 *        What it still catches is a worker from a DIFFERENT master, i.e. the
 *        probe port being answered by a server the scenario did not start.
 *
 *        That is why the relaxation is per-case rather than a file-wide switch:
 *        it is strictly weaker, so it belongs only on the stanza that actually
 *        crosses the signal. A scenario that needs the crash caught across a
 *        reload has to assert it another way -- `no_error_log` on the worker
 *        exit message, or a delta that a respawned worker could not satisfy.
 *
 * Note the master's OWN pid is never asserted to be unchanged: a master that
 * dies takes the whole server with it, so the next probe read fails to connect
 * long before this oracle is reached.
