# A scenario is a directory. Every file in it is optional except the rules --
# and even those may be omitted when a driver.sh is present, because a pure
# orchestration scenario asserts through its driver:
#
#   nginx.conf   conf template with @LOAD@/@PORT@ (default: $PROBER_CONF)
#   *.rule       rule files for the prober         (default: $PROBER_RULES)
#   env          sourced before boot: LD_PRELOAD, ulimit, PROBER_ALLOW_LOG,
#                PROBER_ALLOW_MULTIWORKER, PROBER_DAEMON_MODE, PROBER_PORT
#                overrides -- anything the scenario needs armed before the
#                master process forks. PROBER_DAEMON_MODE=on is the opt-in a
#                USR2 binary-upgrade scenario sets: it inverts the daemon gate
#                (daemon on; + a $PROBER_PREFIX/nginx.pid pidfile required) and
#                switches boot/teardown from tracking the master by $! to
#                tracking it by that pidfile -- USR2 is ignored under daemon off
#   driver.sh    replaces the plain prober invocation (Layer 3): interleaves
#                prober runs with signals to the master, asserts pidfile
#                state, and emits the scenario's TAP itself
#   requires     executable gate; nonzero exit means the scenario is SKIPPED
#                (TAP skip-all), not failed -- missing tool, missing kernel
#                feature, missing locale are environment facts, not bugs
#   backend      fakesrv script; its presence is what starts a fake upstream,
#                on an ephemeral port, before the conf is rendered so
#                @BACKEND_PORT@ can be substituted with the port it bound
#
# Driver contract (exported before driver.sh runs):
#   PROBER_CLIENT      absolute path to the prober binary
#   PROBER_LIB         absolute path to lib.sh (source it for prober_stop etc.)
#   PROBER_SCENARIO    absolute path to the scenario directory
#   PROBER_PREFIX      server prefix; logs at $PROBER_PREFIX/logs/error.log,
#                      pidfile wherever the conf template put it
#   PROBER_SERVER_BIN  server binary (for USR2 binary-upgrade scenarios)
#   PROBER_SERVER_PID  master pid ($!): HUP/USR2/TERM target
#   PROBER_RESOLVED_PORT  the listen port
#   PROBER_BACKEND_PORT   port the fake upstream bound, empty if the scenario
#                         shipped no backend file
#   PROBER_BACKEND_JOURNAL  fakesrv's JSONL journal: what the upstream actually
#                         received and sent, empty if there is no backend.
#                         The only instrument that can see a connection the
#                         module reused rather than reopened
