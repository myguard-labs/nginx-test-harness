# TAP self-test: the schema describes the EMITTER, not just the fixtures.
#
# schema_test.c checks two fixtures against ../probe-schema.json. Both live in
# this repo and are edited by the same hand, so they can agree with each other
# while having drifted away from the code that actually renders the document:
# rename a member in ngx_test_probe_json() and neither notices. This closes
# that loop by reading the format strings in ../src/ngx_test_probe.c.
#
# Grep rather than a compile-and-run: the emitter needs real nginx headers and
# a configured build to execute, which is the runtime leg's job. The member
# NAMES, though, are literal text in the format strings, and a rename is
# exactly the drift being guarded against -- so matching them as text catches
# the failure this suite exists for without needing a server.

# Module-hook members are rendered by the consuming module via zone_render, not
# by this file, so everything found here is legitimately ours to declare.

# Written as a function with two callers -- the real sweep below and the

# a copy of its regex. A duplicated pattern would keep passing when the sweep's
# own pattern is mutated, which is the tautology mutate.sh exists to expose.

# The needle is anchored to the whole key or to the tail component after a
# single dot. A bare suffix match is satisfied by any declared key ENDING in
# the leaf, so a stray "pages_free" would hide behind "slab_pages_free".
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, and the reason schema_test.c exists alongside this file: the
# sweep compares BARE LEAF NAMES and cannot see nesting, so a stray top-level
# "size" is indistinguishable from the declared "zone.size" here. What catches
# that is the closed-level check in schema_test.c, which walks the parsed
# document and rejects any member of the top level, connections or pool that
# the schema does not name.
