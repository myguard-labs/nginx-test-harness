# These tests need no server: they exercise the harness's own parsers and
# assertion evaluators as pure functions. That is deliberate -- the harness
# decides whether a module's test run is green, so a defect in the harness turns
# every rule that depends on it into a test that cannot fail, which is worse
# than a missing test because the run still reports success. Those defects have
# to be catchable without booting nginx, or CI will not catch them at all.
#
# run.sh runs this before it boots a server. CI runs it standalone, twice
# (plain and SAN=1).

# below with one SAN flag, so probing any one settles it for all.
