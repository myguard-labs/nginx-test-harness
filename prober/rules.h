 * rules.h -- the rule-file parser: text in, test cases out.
 *
 * Split out of prober.c so it can be exercised as a pure function by
 * rules_test.c. This parser decides the exact bytes that go on the wire, so a
 * defect here does not fail a test -- it silently tests something other than
 * what the rule file says, which no amount of running the suite would reveal.
 *
 * Rule file syntax -- one case per stanza, blank line separated:
 *
 *     name    ban arms after the configured count
 *     send    GET /guarded?id=1+union+select+1,2,3-- HTTP/1.1\r\n
 *     pause   50
 *     send    Host: t\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n
 *     expect  status=403
 *     expect  body~Forbidden
 *     expect  header~Content-Type: text/html
 *     expect  raw_response_headers_like~^Content-Type:.*text
 *     probe   zone.nodes == 1
 *     delta   fds == 0
 *     probe_baseline  fds == 0
 *     from    127.0.0.9
 *     fault   fault_slab=1
 *     expect_not      body~Internal Server Error
 *     error_code_like ^(2|3)[0-9]{2}$
 *     xfail   known broken until #42 lands
 *
 * `send` is repeatable and concatenates verbatim -- no implied CRLF, no
 * Content-Length synthesis, no header reordering -- so a stanza can spell out a
 * malformed request byte for byte. Escapes: \r \n \t \\ \" \0 \xNN.
 *
 * `pause <ms>` holds the connection open without writing for <ms>
 * milliseconds at the point it appears between `send` lines, so a rule can put
 * a request line on the wire and stall before its headers. That split is what
 * makes partial-header handling, request-header timeouts and smuggling
 * windows testable at all: a single write() hands the server a complete
 * request no matter how many `send` lines built it, because the bytes are
 * concatenated before they reach the socket. A `pause` before the first `send`
 * or after the last is accepted and stalls at that point (an opening stall
 * exercises the server's pre-request idle timeout; a trailing one holds the
 * connection open after a complete request). Bounded to 1..10000 ms per pause
 * and in sum, because a stall longer than the prober's read timeout would
 * report a harness timeout instead of the server behaviour under test.
 *
 * `repeat <count> <text>` appends its text N times, for the cases that need
 * kilobytes of filler to overrun a server limit without making the rule file
 * unreadable.
 *
 * `abort <offset>` writes the first <offset> bytes of the request and then
 * destroys the connection with a TCP reset (SO_LINGER{1,0}), so the server sees
 * ECONNRESET rather than a clean close. This is the client-vanishes-mid-request
 * primitive: it tests that a server releases a request's resources when the
 * peer disappears, instead of holding them until a timeout expires. Offset 0
 * resets before the first byte (connect-then-vanish); an offset past the
 * request end sends all of it and then resets. Pauses inside the written prefix
 * still apply, so `send_slow` followed by `abort` dribbles and then gives up --
 * a real slowloris client's exit.
 *
 * A reset case has NO response, so it may not carry `expect`, `expect_not` or
 * `error_code_like`: those would assert against an empty buffer, and an
 * `expect_not` in particular would pass unconditionally, reporting green for an
 * assertion that tested nothing. The parser rejects the combination at load
 * time. Judge an aborted case with `no_error_log` / `grep_error_log` / `probe`
 * / `delta` -- evidence the server itself produced. For the same reason `abort`
 * and `shutdown` are mutually exclusive: a half-close asks to be answered, a
 * reset says the client is gone.
 *
 * `probe_baseline <path> <op> <value>` subtracts like `delta`, but from the
 * snapshot taken ONCE before the first case of the run rather than from this
 * case's own before-snapshot. It exists because `delta` cannot see a slow
 * drip: `delta` re-reads its before-snapshot per case, so a leak of one unit
 * per case is already present in BOTH of that case's reads and every
 * `delta X == 0` in the file passes while the resource climbs monotonically.
 * The same run judged against a fixed origin fails on the case that crosses
 * the bound.
 *
 * The two are complements, not alternatives: `delta` localises a jump to the
 * case that caused it, `probe_baseline` bounds the total. A file that cares
 * about a leak wants the accumulating one, usually on the LAST case, and
 * usually a bound rather than `== 0` -- a scenario that legitimately warms a
 * cache or opens a keepalive connection has a non-zero honest floor, and
 * writing `== 0` there fails on correct behaviour.
 *
 * The origin is read before any case runs, so it precedes every fault this
 * file arms and every request it sends; unlike `delta`'s, it is NOT taken
 * after arming, and a fault counter reset therefore DOES show up in it. The
 * probe read costs one request per run and is skipped entirely when no case
 * carries the directive.
 *
 * `expect raw_response_headers_like <regex>` asserts a POSIX extended regex
 * against the raw HTTP header block (colon-delimited lines with CRLF
 * terminators, no status line, no body).
 *
 * `expect_close_within <ms>` asserts the SERVER ended the connection within
 * <ms> of the request going on the wire. This is the assertion the transport
 * directives were missing: `hold`, `shutdown` and `send_slow` can all leave a
 * connection in a state the server is supposed to reclaim, but nothing could
 * say by when, so a server that reclaimed it eventually and one that never did
 * produced identical green runs.
 *
 * It judges HOW the connection ended, not what came back, and the three
 * outcomes are kept distinct on purpose:
 *
 *   - the peer sent FIN within the deadline                   -> pass
 *   - the peer sent FIN, but too late                         -> fail, with the
 *     measured time, because "closed at 4000 ms" and "never closed" are
 *     different bugs and a rule author needs to know which one this is
 *   - the deadline passed with the connection still open      -> fail
 *
 * That last one is why the directive changes the transport's timeout from an
 * error into a result: without it the read gives up, the case aborts with
 * "request failed", and the assertion that asked the question never runs.
 * A reset (RST) also counts as closed -- the connection is gone, which is what
 * was asserted -- but it is reported distinctly in the failure text when the
 * deadline was missed, since a server that resets is doing something other
 * than a graceful close.
 *
 * The deadline is measured from the last request byte, so a case that
 * deliberately dribbles its request with `pause` or `send_slow` is not billed
 * for its own pacing. Bounded to 1..10000 ms: a deadline at or past the
 * prober's read timeout could never fail, because the read would give up
 * first, and an assertion that cannot go red is worse than none.
 *
 * Mutually exclusive with `abort` and with `hold`, for the same underlying
 * reason in two costumes: neither case ever reads the socket, so this process
 * never observes a close and there is nothing to time. Under `abort` the
 * CLIENT resets, so the assertion would be judging this process's own
 * behaviour; under `hold` the connection is deliberately left unread and then
 * closed from this side, so the server's own close -- whenever it came -- is
 * invisible here. (`hold` looks like the natural pairing, and it is the right
 * IDEA: an idle-but-open connection is exactly the state worth putting a
 * deadline on. Observing it needs a read-side idle wait rather than hold's
 * blind sleep, which is a separate directive and deliberately not this one.)
 *
 * The pairing that does work today is `shutdown 1`: half-close the sending
 * side, keep reading, and assert the server closes its half within the
 * deadline -- the lingering-close path. A plain request whose response has
 * been fully received works too, and asserts the server does not then sit on
 * an idle connection.
 *
 * `expect_idle <ms>` is the opposite oracle on the same connection state:
 * it asserts the server left the connection OPEN AND SILENT for <ms> after the
 * request, rather than acting on it. It is the read-side idle wait the close
 * deadline's comment above calls for, and the pairing `hold` could not be --
 * `hold` blind-sleeps with the read loop skipped, so a server that closed or
 * answered during the sleep is indistinguishable from one that sat still.
 *
 * The wait POLLS the socket without reading it. Draining would defeat the
 * directive twice over: the response bytes would be collected (so a case could
 * no longer assert the server stayed silent) and the read would consume the
 * very readiness being asserted about. The connection is therefore left exactly
 * as an idle client would leave it.
 *
 * Three outcomes, kept distinct because they are three different server bugs:
 *
 *   - nothing arrived and the connection stayed open for <ms>  -> pass
 *   - the peer sent data before <ms> elapsed                   -> fail, naming
 *     that the server answered, since "answered early" and "hung up early" want
 *     different fixes
 *   - the peer closed (FIN or RST) before <ms> elapsed         -> fail, with the
 *     measured time and the manner of the close
 *
 * Like the close deadline it is measured from the last request byte, so `pause`
 * and `send_slow` pacing is not billed against the wait, and bounded to
 * 1..10000 ms (see MAX_IDLE_MS).
 *
 * Mutually exclusive with `abort` and `hold` for the reason those exclude the
 * close deadline: neither reads or polls the socket, so there is no observation
 * to make. Also mutually exclusive with `expect_close_within` -- one case
 * cannot coherently assert both that the server closes within <n> ms and that
 * it stays open for <m>, and accepting the pair would let whichever assertion
 * ran first decide the verdict.
 *
 * `expect_not` mirrors `expect` (`body~`, `header~`) but asserts the opposite:
 * the case fails if the pattern IS found. A distinct directive rather than a
 * `!~` operator on `expect`, so a rule file reads its polarity at the
 * directive name instead of a symbol easy to misread in a diff.
 *
 * `error_code_like <regex>` is `expect status=` generalised to a POSIX
 * extended regex against the status code rendered as decimal text (e.g.
 * "404"), for cases that accept a class of codes ("any 2xx") rather than one
 * exact value. Compiled at load time so a malformed pattern is a load-time
 * die(), not a run-time surprise on the one case that reaches it.
 *
 * `xfail [reason]` marks the whole case as a known failure: it still runs and
 * is still reported, but a failing xfail case does not fail the suite (TAP
 * `not ok N # TODO <reason>`), and a PASSING xfail case is flagged distinctly
 * (`ok N # TODO <reason>` -- TAP's convention for "this unexpectedly started
 * working"), because that is the signal that the annotation should be removed.
 *
 * `no_error_log <regex>` / `grep_error_log <regex>` assert over the server
 * error-log lines written DURING this case only: no line may match / at least
 * one line must match the POSIX extended regex. The prober records the log
 * file's size immediately before the case's request and evaluates only the
 * bytes appended after that mark -- grep-the-slice, not scrape-the-whole-log,
 * so an earlier case's lines can neither satisfy a grep_error_log nor trip a
 * no_error_log. Both need the log path (prober -e, or PROBER_ERROR_LOG, which
 * run.sh exports); a case carrying either directive FAILS when the path is
 * not configured, because a silently skipped assertion reads as a pass.
 * These are per-case and complement run.sh's whole-run alert/crit/emerg gate,
 * which stays authoritative for severities no rule thought to mention.
