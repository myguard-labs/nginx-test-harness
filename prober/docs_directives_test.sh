# TAP self-test: the README documents the directives the parser accepts.
#
# The rule DSL has exactly one implementation -- the strcmp ladder in
# ../prober/rules.c -- and exactly one reference -- ../README.md. Nothing
# connects them, so the two drift in both directions and neither drift is
# loud:
#
#   * a directive added to the parser and never written down is invisible to
#     everyone who did not add it, which is the whole readership;
#   * a directive documented but removed (or renamed) from the parser sends a
#     reader to write a rule file that dies at load time with "unknown
#     directive", against a README that says otherwise.
#
# Both were live when this file was written: `fault` and `repeat` had been
# accepted by the parser for several releases with no mention in the README.
#
# Grep rather than parse: the directive names are literal text on both sides
# (a strcmp argument in C, a backticked span in markdown), and a rename is
# precisely the drift being guarded against -- so matching them as text
# catches the failure this suite exists for.

# time.
#
# Candidates come from FENCED BLOCKS ONLY. Ordinary prose in this README
# routinely opens a line with a lowercase word followed by more text ("no
# version banner sniffing.", "special HTTP request with..."), which is
# character-for-character the shape of a directive line. Scanning the whole
# file made every one of those a candidate; they were rejected only because no
# prose word happens to collide with a plausible-but-unknown directive name.
# That is luck, not a check -- one future sentence starting "header ..." turns
# this into a bogus "the README teaches directives the parser rejects".
#
# Only UNTAGGED and ```text fences, which is where this README puts rule files.
# The ```sh and ```c fences are the other half of the same problem: they yield
# `git`, `prober`, `static` and `size_t`, none of which are directives and all
# of which have a directive's line shape.
# A closing fence is always a bare ```, so "is this untagged" cannot tell an
# opener from a closer -- the state has to be tracked explicitly.
#
# A fence qualifies as a rule file by CONTENT, not by tag: it must carry a
# `name` line, which every case begins with. Tag alone is not enough, because
# the untagged fences also hold shell commands and an ASCII architecture
# diagram whose first column ("prober (standalone binary) ...") has exactly a
# directive's shape. Buffering to decide per fence costs nothing at this size.
