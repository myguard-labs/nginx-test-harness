 * assert_test.c -- TAP self-test for the assertion evaluators.
 *
 * These two functions ARE the verdict. Everything else in the harness exists to
 * put a document in front of them: the prober sends the request, http.c reads
 * the bytes, json.c turns them into values, and then eval_probe() and
 * eval_delta() decide whether a case passed.
 *
 * Which makes one failure mode dominant, and it is not "reports a failure that
 * is not real". It is the opposite: an evaluator that returns pass where it
 * should return fail makes every rule depending on it untestable by
 * construction, and the run still prints ok. Nobody investigates an ok. So the
 * bulk of what follows checks that assertions which CANNOT be meaningfully
 * evaluated -- absent paths, type mismatches, unusable literals, an unavailable
 * fd count -- come back as failures rather than as quiet passes.
 *
 * The `fds == -1` case is the sharpest example and has its own guard in
 * eval_delta(): when the probe cannot read /proc/self/fd it reports -1, both
 * snapshots carry -1, and the subtraction cancels them to a delta of 0. Every
 * `delta fds == 0` rule in every consuming module would pass while measuring
 * nothing at all.
