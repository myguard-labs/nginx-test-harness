 * schema_test.c -- the probe document keeps the shape ../probe-schema.json
 * promises.
 *
 * A rule that NAMES a field already fails loudly when the probe stops emitting
 * it: eval_probe reports `probe path "..." not present in document`. This suite
 * covers the half that is otherwise silent -- a field renamed, retyped or
 * dropped while no current rule happens to reference it, which stays invisible
 * until someone writes a rule against it much later and reads the failure as a
 * bug in their rule.
 *
 * Two directions, and both are needed:
 *
 *   FORWARD  every field the schema promises is present, with the promised
 *            type, in a document of the matching variant. Catches a drop or a
 *            retype.
 *
 *   REVERSE  every member the emitter renders at a closed level is named by
 *            the schema. Catches an ADDED field that nobody wrote down --
 *            without this the schema decays into a subset that passes forever
 *            while describing less and less of the document.
 *
 * The schema is read as text rather than linked as a struct on purpose: the
 * point is to check the checked-in file, and a copy compiled into this binary
 * would drift from it exactly as silently as the thing being guarded against.
