# TAP self-test: prober_render_conf() substitutes every placeholder a scenario
# conf is allowed to use.
#
# This exists because @PREFIX@ was NOT substituted for the entire life of the
# scenario tree. Every scenario conf sets `pid`/`error_log` under @PREFIX@, so
# the literal string reached nginx, open() failed, and the config test bailed
# before a single request ran. Nothing in this repo executes the scenario tree
# -- it runs in consuming module repos -- so the breakage was invisible here.
#
# The guard is therefore two-sided: the placeholders the renderer claims to
# handle must actually be replaced (a rendered conf carrying a literal @NAME@
# is the bug), and every @NAME@ appearing in any checked-in scenario conf must
# be one the renderer knows. The second half is what turns a future scenario
# using @UPSTREAM@ into a red test instead of another silent bail.
