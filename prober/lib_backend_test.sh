#
# The status-preservation cases come first because they are the reason this
# function is written the way it is: an EXIT trap's own status becomes the
# script's, so a cleanup that clobbers $? turns a failing scenario green with
# every assertion in the TAP stream still reading ok. Asserting merely that
# cleanup "runs" would not catch that -- the VALUE is the claim.
#
# Each case runs in a SUBSHELL that seeds $? and exits with what cleanup
# returned. A bare `( exit N )` in this file would trip `set -e` and kill the
# script mid-plan -- and a truncated TAP stream reads as "the rest passed",
# which is the trap lessons.md already records twice.
# The seeded status is the LAST thing before the call, with nothing in
# between to reset it.
# `set -e` stays ON inside here, deliberately. run-scenario.sh runs under
# `set -euo pipefail`, so that is the shell prober_cleanup must survive: an
# unguarded command in it aborts the trap partway and never reaches the
# `return "$rc"`. A helper that relaxed to `set +e` would absorb exactly that
# failure and report the mutant as caught while the assertion never ran --
# the vacuous-gate mode this file already documents twice.
#
# The seeded status has to reach prober_cleanup INTACT, and `set -e` would
# abort on the seed itself. An EXIT trap is the one construct that gives both:
# it is how the real caller invokes cleanup anyway, and `exit N` sets $? to N
# without `set -e` intervening. So this mirrors production exactly.

# sees a new worker time out instead of hanging, is a failed `before` read
# fatal rather than silently degrading. None of that needs a server, and
# requiring one would mean this file could not run without a build.
#
# The reload behaviour itself -- that a HUP really does swap the worker -- is
# not asserted here and cannot be: it belongs to the scenario that uses it.

# Serve a canned HTTP response to every connection, using fakesrv itself.
#
# Not nc(1): fakesrv_test.sh:13 records why this repo never depends on it --
# it is absent on some boxes and the openbsd/traditional/ncat variants take
# incompatible listen flags, so a suite built on it fails for reasons that have
# nothing to do with what it asserts. (Confirmed while writing this: the box it
# was first run on carries the traditional variant, whose `-l -p PORT` spelling
# differs from the one most examples use, and the stub silently never bound.)
#
# python3 instead, the same listener this file already uses for
# prober_wait_listen above -- no new dependency.
#
# Serves EVERY connection, not one: prober_signal_wait probes at least twice
# (once for the before-pid, then once per poll step), and a one-shot listener
