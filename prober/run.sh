#   PROBER_DIRECTIVE directive proving the harness build (required)

# consumer contract, unchanged. Scenario trees (per-scenario conf/env/driver)
# run through run-scenario.sh and test-scenarios.sh; all three scripts share
# the same engine in lib.sh, so a fix to boot, teardown or the log scrape
# lands in every entry point at once instead of drifting apart.
#
# The build must have been made with the harness enabled, otherwise the probe
# directive does not exist and the config fails to load; the engine checks for
# that up front rather than letting it surface as a confusing connect error.
