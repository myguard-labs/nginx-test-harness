 * prober.c -- rule-driven HTTP prober for nginx/angie modules.
 *
 * This file is the driver only: it walks the cases, issues the requests, and
 * prints TAP. The parts that decide anything live beside it, so they can be
 * tested without a server -- rules.c (text -> cases), assert.c (documents ->
 * verdicts), json.c (the oracle), http.c (the wire).
 *
 * Module-agnostic by construction: every case is data in a .rule file, and the
 * only thing this knows about the module under test is the probe endpoint's
 * JSON shape, which ngx_test_probe.c keeps generic.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside the Perl suite in t/ rather than replacing it:
 *
 *   1. It runs against ANGIE. Stock Test::Nginx::Socket probes the server's
 *      version banner and requires "nginx version: x.y" (Util.pm:1365); angie
 *      answers "Angie version: Angie/1.12.0", so the harness bails before the
 *      first test and the angie CI leg has only ever been build-and-load. This
 *      prober reads no banner, so the same rules run on both servers.
 *
 *   2. It asserts on IN-WORKER state, not just the response. A rule can require
 *      that the ban zone gained exactly one node, which no amount of response
 *      matching can establish.
 *
 * See rules.h for the rule-file syntax.
 *
 * `from 127.0.0.9` binds the client socket to a local source address, so a
 * rule can present itself as a distinct peer. Ban behaviour is keyed on the
 * peer, so this is what makes per-address ban logic testable at all.
 *
 * Every request must ask for Connection: close; see http.h for why.
 *
 * Output is TAP, so `prove` consumes it exactly like the Perl suite.
