# TAP self-test: prober_scrape_log() treats a sanitizer/UBSan report as a fatal,
# never-exemptable finding, distinct from an ordinary alert/crit/emerg line.
#
# The scenarios job now has a SAN=1 matrix leg that boots an AddressSanitizer/
# UBSan-instrumented server. A worker use-after-free or overflow aborts with a
# sanitizer banner, which nginx writes to its redirected fd 2 (the error_log
# after config load, the launcher's server.err before it). That banner is NOT
# an nginx severity line, so the alert/crit/emerg grep cannot see it, and
# PROBER_ALLOW_LOG -- which legitimately exempts an expected [crit] slab
# exhaustion -- must NEVER be able to exempt it. This guards both claims.
