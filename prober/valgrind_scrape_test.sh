# TAP self-test: proves the valgrind gate is NOT vacuous.
#
# `valgrind --error-exitcode=N` is the belt: without it memcheck exits 0 by
# DEFAULT even when it reported errors -- exit status alone answers "did the
# child crash", not "did memcheck find anything". A gate that trusted only the
# exit code would therefore stay green on any build that forgot the flag, or
# on a log written by a valgrind process that was never told to fail the exit
# code at all. prober_scrape_valgrind (lib.sh) is the suspenders: it greps the
# log text regardless of what the exit code says, which is what makes the
# combination non-vacuous. This file proves BOTH halves, and proves them
# against the SAME planted error so neither claim is asserted in isolation:
#
#   1. --error-exitcode=99 DOES make a real memcheck finding fail the process.
#   2. Exit 0 WITHOUT that flag on the identical finding proves the flag was
#      necessary -- the vacuity this whole leg exists to rule out.
#   3. prober_scrape_valgrind() itself returns 1 on the error log, 0 on a
#      clean one -- the function the engine actually calls, not a proxy for it.
#
# No server, no nginx build: this compiles two tiny throwaway C programs and
# runs them under the system valgrind, so it costs seconds, not the minutes a
# real scenario run under memcheck costs, and runs on every `./test.sh`
# invocation rather than only in the weekly valgrind job.
